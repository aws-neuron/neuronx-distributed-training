Welcome to Neuronx Distributed Training Library's documentation!
================================================================

Neuronx Distributed Training is a framework which extends
`Neuronx Distributed (NxD) <https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/neuronx-distributed/index.html>`_
by integrating NeMo's ML and Data engineering features and introducing end-to-end model training examples via a
user-friendly NeMo-like interface. The framework can onboard Megatron models, HuggingFace style models, and even
custom models built by users.
